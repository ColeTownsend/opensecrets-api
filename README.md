# OpenSecrets API

A simple library for the Center of Responsive Politics (CRP) OpenSecrets API. Their website currently features libraries for Python, PHP, and Ruby, so I figured this project would be a welcome addition for JavaScript users looking to play around with some political data.

Note: Use of the OpenSecrets.org API (Service) is provided free for educational, research, and non-commercial use. Commercial uses and republishing of data obtained obtained via this Service may involve a fee.
